Problem 2
without forwarding : 3
we had an example in class, essentially because
we cannot forward the data, we have to put a hold
on the addl to wait for the %eax and %ebx values
to be ready to use. We end up waiting 3 stalls 
for the %ebx value to be freed up (%eax takes
2, but not relevent to final answer)

with forwarding : 0
unlike in the last example, forwarding alows us to 
kind of cheat and grab values early, without stalls
this alows us to grab ebx before is has passed all
way through the pipeline, without waiting
